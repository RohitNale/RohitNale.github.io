  <h3> Suspicious Human Activity Detection Using Pose Estimation and LSTM</h3>
  <ul>
    Design and implement a Deep Learning model to classify suspicious activity for surveillance and health care. Geometric relational features are used to detect human Suspicious activities, the sequence of features is used to train the RNN/LSTM model. The model is implemented in python using TensorFlow and Keras, it efficiently learns the key point features and returns an activity class. This approach is based on the sequential information from 3D features, Geometric Pose Descriptor is a pose distance metrics which sufficiently reflect the pose similarity of human actions in different activities. The proposed method shows overall accuracy of 89.07% on cross view and 81.71% on cross subject evaluation on NTU-60 activity data set.

  <h3>Microstrip Patch Antenna designed for 2.4GHz</h3>
  <ul>
    Microstrip Patch antenna consists of a flat conductive sheet i.e., patch of a particular shape like a rectangle, triangle, circular, etc., mounted over a larger sheet of metal called a ground plane. A patch antenna (pin feed) is designed to operate close to 2.4GHz using CAD Feko software in this antenna design.
